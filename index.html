                <p>From July 2023 to November 2024 I was a bioinformatics engineer for <a href="https://signaturedx.com"
                        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signature Diagnostics</a>, a biotech startup which
                    develops assays for non-invasive prenatal screening.</p>

                <p>At Signature, I transitioned a binary classifier based on a proprietary algorithm into a
                    multi-class classifier which used a separate algorithm I developed to filter out misleading data.</p>

                <p>One of the focuses of the analytics team I was on was to ensure that the statistical results we were
                    getting resembled what we know to be biologically true. To this end I conducted an analysis
                    comparing a proprietary
                    algorithm with various regression models to see to what extend to genes identified by the algorithms
                    were on similar
                    genetic pathways, or the pathways that we expected.</p>

                <p>My final project at Signature Diagnostics was to use retreival augmentation generation to improve the
                    ability of an LLM
                    to describe what we already know. I was able to get more specific results using pathways rather than
                    specific genes as
                    augmentaion data.</p>

                <p>From August 2022 to November 2024 I was a spectroscopy and computer vision researcher for <a

                    Purdue University run by Professor Thomas Beechem.
                </p>

                <p>
                    While working with Professor Beechem I developed an algorithm which uses non-negative matrix
                    factorization to detect contaminants in mediums such as water. By decomposing the spectral data into
                    its component weights and eigenvectors (which we call 'eigenspectra'), we can use the weights alone
                    to determine whether a substance is contaminated using far less data than standard methods.

                </p>
                <p>We believe that this algorithm will pave the way for the development of highly effective, but also
                    affordable, spectroscopy systems as opposed to the current systems which are either expensive and
                    accurate, or cheap and less accurate.

                    In 2018, I joined OneLoop, the Hyperloop team at UC Davis, where I designed a failure reporter to
                    indicate whether our racing pod was encountering any issues. That summer, our team placed in the top
                    21 teams globally and was invited to race our pod at the SpaceX facility.

                    new braking and propulsion systems and secured sponsorships such as ANSYS. The team is now working
                    towards competing in European Hyperloop Week.

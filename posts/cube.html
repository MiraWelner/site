        <h1>When a Hyperspectral Image is a Cube</h1>

        <p>When I was interning at Carnegie Mellon Vision Science Labs the summer after my junior year, I was
            having difficulty running the code in a way that did not cause my small computer to crash. So, Professor
            Sankaranarayanan told me to ask one of his graduate students for ways to make more efficient pipelines. I
            told her I was working with hyperspectral images. She paused for a second and asked, "Are those cubes?" I
            responded that they were. We eventually figured out a solution to the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are at all familiar with spectroscopy, or or vision science in general, you are probably
            wondering why they referred to hyperspectral images as 'cubes'. I will explain why. Let's say you want to
            have a black and white image stored on a computer. The data looks like a square. Each value in the square
            is a value from 0 to 1, with 0 being black and 1 being white. It looks kind of like this:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="blog-image-center" src="../images/b_w.png" alt="Black and white image representation">
        </figure>
        <p>
            What about color images? It's not much more complex than black and white because it doesn't take much to
            make the human eye perceive color. We call red, green, and blue the 'primary colors,' but that doesn't mean
            that all colors are made up of red, green,
            and blue. If you create light with a wavelength of 570–580 nanometers, you are going to
            see yellow. Red, green, and blue are not present. However, if you have red light (620 to 750 nm) and
            green light (490–580 nm), your brain will think
            you are seeing yellow light. You are not! But our eyes are designed for fairly basic tasks, so it's
            all we need. As a result, most computer screens
            have only red, green, and blue diodes. That means that colored images are stored in computers like
            this:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="blog-image-center" src="../images/color_rep.png" alt="Color image representation">
        </figure>
        <p>
            With our limited eyes, we have a pretty good idea of the world around us. But what if we could get a
            computer eye that could differentiate much narrower shades of color than a human eye can? There
            would be one matrix for 490 to 495 nm, another for 495 to 500 nm, etc. That is what a hyperspectral image
            is! You can't really display it on a standard screen because that isn't what
            computers are designed to do, but you can get lots of data on what the substance you are observing is. And,
            since there will be hundreds or thousands of matrices all stacked on top of each other, it looks kind of
            like a cube! And that is why the graduate student called it a cube.
        </p>

            A year after this, I was working in Specere Labs, which studies light and spectroscopy. I was explaining to
            some other researchers what I had been studying at CMU. But they didn't see hyperspectral images as cubes;
            they saw them as groups of spectra.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specere labs studied spectroscopy, but it rarely involved itself in the study of hyperspectral images.
            The focus more was on the actual mechanisms of the infrared spectroscopy experimental equipment itself. 
            Thus, the focus was more on materials science, heat transfer science, and chemistry.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a spectrometer is used, it typically returns a spectra which looks somewhat like this:
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img class="blog-image-center" src="../images/spectra.png" alt="Spectra representation">
        </figure>
        <p>
            The above plot could be seen as a cross-section of a hyperspectral image, but almost nobody thinks
            about it like that because that
            is not how the spectral data is typically obtained. So in Specere Labs, hyperspectral images were
            not cubes. They were groups of spectra
            taken from regions nearby each other.
        </p>
        <p>
            So while I don't think this information is earth-shattering, I think it does illustrate why I really
            enjoy cross-disciplinary work and
            learning from multiple professors in multiple labs.

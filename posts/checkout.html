        <h1>Can we communally deprecate git checkout?</h1>
        <p>I will start with the disclaimer that I really like git. I use it on nearly all of my programming
            projects, have read the entirety of Pro Git, and every lab or company I have worked at has held its
            codebase on GitHub, with the exception of the National Ignition Facility. For some reason, they use
            Accurev, or at least they did when I worked there in 2019, which was much worse.
        </p>
        <p>I understand that git is an evolving open-source system, meaning that there are going to be redundant
            commands. This has resulted in many people having their own git 'workflows' consisting of somewhat
            arbitrary decisions they happened to make regarding which commands to use. For example, when attempting
            to squash the last n commits together, I prefer to use <code class='code-line'>git rebase -i HEAD~n</code>
            rather than
            <code class='code-line'>git reset --soft HEAD~n</code> or <code
                class='code-line'>git merge --squash HEAD@{n}</code>. Why? In part, because
            I like creating a new commit message based on a concatenation of the commit messages for each commit I
            am squashing, but mostly because of muscle memory. The only time I ever consciously changed which
            command I use for a process was when I learned of the existence of <code
                class='code-line'>git switch</code>, and started
            using it to change and create branches rather than <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>. This is
            because
            <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>, as a command, is a complete and total disaster.
        </p>
        <p>Git checkout seems to go out of its way to be an absolute fiasco of a command. The official git
            documentation describes <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code> as a function to "Switch branches or
            restore working
            tree files." That is <i>already</i> two different things that have little to do with each other, and
            it's not even the full picture of what this sprawling, overloaded command is capable of. I think a more
            thorough description would be: "It moves you from one branch to another, or creates a new branch which
            it moves you to, or it reverts specific files to versions of themselves n commits prior. It also can
            remove all unstaged files while reverting staged files to the version of themselves when they were
            staged, or it can create a detached HEAD state." What does this even mean? That is not even a coherent
            sentence! Why did people decide to make a single command do <i>all of Git's functionality?</i> What is
            this madness?</p>
        <p>Pro Git, the official book on git written by one of the founders of GitHub, fully admits that the
            checkout command is an utterly cursed incarnation of Cthulhu, along with the reset function:</p>
        <blockquote>These commands are two of the most confusing parts of git when you first encounter them. They do
            so many things that it seems hopeless to actually understand them and employ them properly.</blockquote>
        <p>The book then proceeds to give a thorough explanation of the checkout and reset functions (you can find
            it <a href='https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Reset-Demystified'>here</a>), which ends up being
            one of the best explanations I have found of how Git functions as a whole. The reason it is such an
            excellent explaination of git is because the only way to really understand deeply how
            <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>
            works, <i>you have to fundamentally understand
                the internal workings of git</i>. And that is all well and good, but <code
                class='code-line'>git checkout</code> is a
            command taught to people who are new to git, and a command that requires such a deep understanding of
            how git works should, <i>not be a general-use command</i>.
        </p>
        <figure class="blog-image-right" style="margin-bottom:4em">
            <img src="../images/xkcd_github.png">
            <figcaption> If that doesn't fix it, git.txt contains the phone number of a friend of mine who
                understands git. Just wait through a few minutes of 'It's really pretty simple, just think of
                branches as...' and eventually you'll learn the commands that will fix everything.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In all seriousness, I do believe that, given a proper understanding of how git actually works,
            <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code> makes sense. If you have a good grasp of how HEAD points to the
            current
            branch, and the branch is just a pointer to a commit, <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code> can be
            viewed as a
            command which moves the HEAD from branch to branch or sometimes from branch to a specific commit.
            Normally, I would just say that this means that programmers should develop a deeper understanding of how
            git works before using it, but the reason that git is different is that the vast majority of people who
            I have taught how to use git were not developers. For non-programmers, git can be useful not as a
            version control system, but as a way to access GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>The first time I ever explained git to somebody, they had not asked me to explain git, they had asked me
            to explain GitHub. They were in a biomedical engineering lab which had decided to put all their code in
            GitHub so it could be centralized, and they could all see each other's code. People didn't typically
            collaborate on individual code projects so they didn't really need branches, they just needed to all
            have the code in the same location so everybody could access it. The lab had asked one of the
            undergraduate programmers to explain to the group how to use GitHub. They had done a bad job at
            explaining how it worked, so I
            explained <code class='code-line'>git init</code>, <code class='code-line'>git add</code>, <code
                class='code-line'>git commit</code>, <code class='code-line'>git push</code>,
            and <code class='code-line'>git pull</code> which is a very small fraction of git functionality, but if the
            only reason
            that a lab uses git is to put all the code in one location, that is the extent of what you need.
        </p>
        <p>The second time I explained git to somebody, it was as part of a presentation to Specere Labs at Purdue
            University. I again focused on <code class='code-line'>git init</code>, <code
                class='code-line'>git add</code>, <code class='code-line'>git commit</code>,
            <code class='code-line'>git push</code>, and <code class='code-line'>git pull</code>. However, because it
            was a fairly large lab and some
            projects involved multiple people working on the same codebase, I also explained <code
                class='code-line'>git branch</code>
            and <code class='code-line'>git switch</code> because branches are useful with larger groups. However,
            despite their use
            of branches, I never explained to them how <code class='code-line'>git merge</code> and <code
                class='code-line'>git rebase</code> work
            because all of their branch merging would be done on GitHub via pull requests. Merge is complicated, and
            it wasn't very useful given what the lab was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For these groups of people using git, <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code> is extremely confusing!
            And they are
            also the most likely to stumble upon it since rather than reading the documentation they will look up
            pre-written scripts online. I know that as software engineers, we don't typically want to change
            our methodologies for the sake of people who are using tools built for us despite
            not being real software engineers themselves, but at this point GitHub isn't just for software
            engineers.
            Also, we wouldn't be losing anything because <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code> is a pain to us as
            well!
        </p>

            <img src="../images/workflow.png">
            <figcaption>There are probably children out there holding down spacebar to stay warm in the winter! YOUR
                UPDATE MURDERS CHILDREN.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I'm not calling for Git to remove <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>. They have been pretty clear
            that it isn't
            something they are looking to do, since removing the backward compatibility of basic git commands would
            break a lot of scripts, and they have already added the more sensible <code
                class='code-line'>git switch</code> and
            <code class='code-line'>git restore</code>. If somebody wants to update their workflow to more sane
            commands, they can
            simply use those two rather than the ungodly <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>. Git is an
            open-source project
            which has to provide functional version control for groups ranging from the Linux development team, who
            presumably use commands like <code class='code-line'>git rerere</code> and <code
                class='code-line'>git bisect</code>, to mechanical
            engineering labs who just want to put MATLAB on an accessible website, and it is doing a fantastic job
            of it.
        </p>
        <p>The issue, however, is that most people who know git don't learn it from Pro Git, they learn it from
            their friends and Stack Overflow. I used git badly for an embarrassingly long time before actually going
            through the documentation and learning what each command really does. Most people are learning the
            individual workflows of their friends and internet people, which often include
            <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>. So I am not asking for an official deprecation, but rather a
            communal deprecation. Just stop teaching junior developers to use checkout because chances are it will
            be entombed in their muscle memory for a long while after.
        </p>
        <p> If you are a person who contributes to Stack Overflow (thank you, by the way) or
            gives advice to junior developers (also thank you), please stop teaching them to use
            <code class='code-line'>git checkout</code>! Teach them <code class='code-line'>git switch</code> and <code
                class='code-line'>git restore</code>. Or if you
            don't like restore, try reset which is also somewhat cursed but less cursed than checkout. Git is
            an amazing version control system, but it's better if you avoid the eldritch horrors hidden within.

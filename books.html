        <h1>Programming Books</h1>
        <p> It is a common sentiment that the best way to learn programming is to work on projects rather than read books. While I agree with this, I can't say 
            I have ever met anybody who only reads books on code but doesn't work on projects. I don't think that is a common phenomenon? Whereas it is quite 
            common for people to work as software engineers but read very few books. Personally I think a balance is good. Here are books some I recomend!

                <h2>Fluent Python</h2>
                <p>
                    Python is often learned by looking up points of confusion on the fly. While that is a fine way to learn, 
                    there is much about Python that goes underutilized because people don't know it is an option. This book goes into detail about 
                    Python's unique properties!

        <h1>Biotech Books</h1>
        <p> I'm not a biologist, but I <i>do</i> work in biotech which means I work with biologists. Every once in a
            while somebody who I'm on a project
            with will say 'here read this book' in an attempt to make me less bad at biology. The following are the ones
            that have minimized my badness at biology to the highest degree.</p>

                <h2>CryoEM101.org</h2>
                <p>This is technically a website with chapters, but I consider it close enough to a book to list it here. When I joined Dr. Xu's lab at CMU 
                    they gave me a large spreadsheet with various recources so I could work on a project with them, and this was the best learning recource listed 
                    there in my opinion.

                <h2>Getting Started in Cryo-EM</h2>
                <p>This is also technically not a book, it is a YouTube series by Dr. Jensen at Caltech. It was also given to me when I first joined Dr. Xu's lab, and 
                    not only did it help get me started on understanding how Cryo-ET and Cryo-EM work, but it gave one of the best intuitive explanations of 
                    how fourier transforms work. Highly reccomended for anybody learning about electron microsocpy!
